# Time Series Analysis & Forecasting
This project is about Time Series Analysis & Forecasting with ARIMA and SARIMA models  
## Description  
The prediction task was to forecast the monthly average gold prices from August 2020 to August 2021, taking the data from January 2017 - July 2020 as input.  
In this project, the time series data was first analysed, considering the nature and structure of it, and then developed various models namely, Holt’s Linear Trend method (a.k.a Double Exponential Smoothing), Holt-Winters’ Seasonal method and SARIMA, in an attempt to find the model best-suited for the dataset. The prediction task was to forecast the monthly average gold prices from August 2020 to August 2021, taking the data from January 2017 - July 2020 as input.
